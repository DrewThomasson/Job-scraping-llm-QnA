The story around Kodiak is an impressive one. Derek Bang, the practice founder and inventor of the group\u2019s flagship software product for net revenue reporting, Revenue Cycle Analytics (RCA) came to Crowe nearly 20 years ago with an idea for a strategic pursuit in the Healthcare Industry through his previous experience as a Healthcare Auditor at a Big 4 firm.

Kodiak currently services more than 1,800 hospitals and 200,000 practice-based physicians across all 50 states. Due to the unique complexities of the business such as technology and data security, it is time for a new partner with the appropriate expertise and resources to invest in the future growth of Kodiak.

And ever since, the happiness, development, and contribution of every Workmate is central to who we are. Our Workmates believe a healthy employee-centric, collaborative culture is the essential mix of ingredients for success in business. That\u2019s why we look after our people, communities and the planet while still being profitable. Feel encouraged to shine, however that manifests: you don\u2019t need to hide who you are. You can feel the energy and the passion, it's what makes us unique. Inspired to make a brighter work day for all and transform with us to the next stage of our growth journey? Bring your brightest version of you and have a brighter work day here.\nAbout the Team\nAre you passionate about keeping millions of customers\u2019 data safe? Workday\u2019s Platform Reliability Engineering team is dedicated to provide a resilient infrastructure for our Data Security & Privacy and Identity and Access Management (IAM) products for Workday. We are working on one of the top priorities for Workday with a strong customer demand.\n\nIn Security Products we\u2019re using the latest technologies to build platforms and services to support our growth while also ensuring the protection of Workday data and infrastructure is paramount. As a part of this team, you will help build and support enterprise grade security tools and services for the Security Products initiatives.\nAbout the Role\nThis role\u2019s charter is to develop, build, deploy, and support the security specific solutions and infrastructure to help protect Workday customers data. We have a hybrid schedule where you will have the opportunity to collaborate with Workmates at the office but still have the flexibility to work up to 50% remote.\nThe successful candidate will have a proven potential to work in a production focused diverse organization. You will be working in a rapidly moving microservices environment where resilience and scalability are key non-functional requirements. This will require you to work efficiently within your own team but also to coordinate with others in teams both locally and in other timezones.

Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work.
