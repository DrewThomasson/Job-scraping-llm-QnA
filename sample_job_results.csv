The graduate CS program is currently ranked 6th and the undergraduate 5th nationally by U.S. News and World Report. The College consists of five Schools that provide specialized and general computing education to the entire campus. With over 16-degree programs, including its world-renowned online MS in CS, we believe the College to be the largest Computing unit in the United States and, as such, one of the largest producers of computationalist at all levels and of all demographic backgrounds. The College is a part of the Georgia Institute of Technology, a unit of the University System of Georgia and is primarily located in the heart of Atlanta, Georgia.
